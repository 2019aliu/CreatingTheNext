Anticipated above-average precipitation due to El Niño could lead to devastating outcomes due to current drought conditions. Read our Briefing Note on floods in south and west Afghanistan in March 2019.INFORM measures Afghanistan’s risk of humanitarian crisis and disaster to be very high, at 7.8/10, putting it at rank 4 on the global crisis level. Afghanistan rates 8.8/10 for hazard and exposure and 7.5/10 for a lack of coping capacity. ACCESS SITUATIONInsecurity and the presence of NSAG hamper the delivery of humanitarian assistance across the country. At least 46 districts are classified as hard-to-reach areas, where needs for multi-cluster interventions are estimated to be high but only limited data is available. Access to areas controlled or contested by NSAG is especially constricted, as NSAG demand illegal taxation and humanitarian workers report pressure from government officials not to respond to these areas. Decades of conflict have left major supply roads in very poor condition and are often targeted by NSAGs. Land mine contamination and targeting of humanitarian aid workers further add to access constraints.  ",2019-05-29T14:15:57.000Z,ACAPS,https://www.acaps.org/country/afghanistan,en

The economy has declined significantly due to political instability and insecurity and with the suspension of foreign aid, which was 48% of the national income in 2015. Despite a decrease in overt violence since 2016, violations such as disappearances and torture by the police, military, and the ruling party’s youth league, Imbonerakure, persist. The economic crisis, widespread poverty, and climatic factors are the main drivers of food insecurity. Although the number of people facing food insecurity has declined in 2018, 1.67 million people are still estimated to face crisis and emergency levels, exacerbated by population density and movement. The main trigger of internal displacement are climatic hazards such as dry spells or floods, therefore IDP figures vary across seasons. 65% of the Burundian population live below the poverty line and it is the country most affected by chronic malnutrition worldwide. INFORM measures Burundi's risk of humanitarian crisis and disaster as high, at 6/10, with high scores for both vulnerability (6.7/10) and lack of coping capacities (6.5/10). Access situationHumanitarian access is a concern in Burundi due to administrative and physical obstacles, and a general lack of information. Administrative obstacles and insecurity resulting from the socioeconomic situation are preventing needs assessments and response, particularly in remote areas where needs are highest. The rainy season and poor quality of roads create additional physical access constraints.In 2018, Burundi’s politics continued to be characterised by repression and isolation, further alienating itself from neighboring countries. The Burundian government heavily regulates NGO activity and movement in the country. In October 2018, international NGOs, with the exemption of those operating in hospitals and schools, were suspended, risking deregistration unless they presented four documents – including a cooperation agreement signed with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, an agreement with the Ministry of Finance and a plan to implement ethnic quotas of staff – within three months.  Although many INGOs have complied with the demands, the temporary suspension impeded humanitarian service provision, is likely to increase control over INGOs activities, and could potentially reignite ethnical tensions. In early December 2018, Burundi ordered the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Burundi to close. Humanitarian offices' closures were reported in 2017.",2019-05-29T14:15:57.000Z,ACAPS,https://www.acaps.org/country/burundi,en
